## Source Control - GitHub(git preferred)

-   ### Branches - master, beta and develop.
-   ### Follow the given [style guide](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/)
    -   feat: a new feature
    -   fix: a bug fix
    -   docs: changes to documentation
    -   style: formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change
    -   refactor: refactoring production code
    -   test: adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change
    -   chore: updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc;no code change
    -   production code change
-   ### Pull requests to be made from develop to beta and beta to develop
-   ### Squash commits when creating a pull request to beta from develop
-   ### Use Prettier to format the code before commit.
<!-- To Do: Establish pre-commit hooks  -->

## Client Side - ReactJSX

-   ### [Use Typescript (TSX)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html)

-   ### All code needs to be documented with JSDoc and better-docs comments. [Reference](https://gist.github.com/aniketbiprojit/faae9a4113786c37025ba934d45be1ca)

-   ### Different folders for containers, actions, constant and features.

    -   #### Components : includes folders for stateful classes and their respective SCSS.
    -   #### Features: Functionality added to the components in a stateless or stateful manner or hooks. Not required to be created explicitly.
    -   #### Containers: Bind one or more components or features together and exports a default function to return these in a stateless manner.
    -   #### Constants: routes.json, actions.json, etc.
    -   #### Actions : Reducers and Actions for react-redux

-   ### Stateful Classes

    -   #### Define Props and States externally as types and/or interfaces as per TSX reccomendation with annotations and comments
    -   #### Constructor should be documented if any.
    -   #### Avoid using an async constructor. Use componentDidMount for async/await operations if required.
    -   #### Bindings for every function regardless of their access to State.

-   ### Routing

    -   #### It needs to handled with react-router or connected-react-router with BrowserRouter as primary router and all routes should be defined as constants in routes.json file.
    -   #### Use React.lazy if possible.

*   ### Actions

    -   #### Use react-redux
    -   #### Extend with redux-thunk if necessary
    -   #### External binding of ConnectedRouter

*   ### Tests
<!-- TODO -->

## Server Side - ExpressJS
